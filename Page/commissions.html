                <section>
                    <h2>COMMISSIONS INCLUDE:</h2>
                    <p>
                        A JPEG or PNG file of each agreed upon versions of the commission. A sketch will be provided between the initial payment and the final payment to ensure the client's satisfaction. Timelapse will be provided along with the commission if requested.
                    </p>

                    <h2>PAYMENT:</h2>
                    <p>
                        A [redacted<!--PayPal-->] payment is required. All currency must be converted to euro(‚Ç¨). Payments are required when the order as been confirmed and after the sketch has been approved by both parties. For sketch commissions, the payment is required in full upfront.
                        <br/>
                        Exposure isn't a valid form of payment.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Refunds are only available until I send the final product to you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>ORDERING:</h2>
                    <p>
                        To order, as said previously, you can DM me or send an e-mail, or you can fill out a form.
                        <br/>
                        If you filled a form, I will review what you're looking to order.
                        <br/>
                        You may request some minor alterations in a reasonable quantity before or after the piece is finished and sent without any additional payment.
                        <br/>
                        You may request more major changes after the piece is finished and sent for an additional payment.
                        <br/>
                        I will post any rendered commissions on social media unless told against.
                    </p>

                    <h2>TIME WINDOW:</h2>
                    <p>
                        I shouldn't take more than <mark>a month</mark> to complete your commission. But if you've been waiting for longer than that period, you are free to ask for updates on your commission.
                        <br/>
                        My weeks are ever changing so I can either finish your commission in a week or a month, but I will be faster either way during the holidays.
                    </p>

                    <h2>RIGHTS:</h2>
                    <p>
                        As creator, I hold the rights to my artwork no matter what content if depicts, other's OCs or otherwise. Upon payment, I give the commissioner permission to edit, repost, print and share any artwork created for them with proper credit. You're free to use your commission as you wish for personal use only. Commissioners do not have the rights to redistribute my work unless payment for the rights are specifically given.
                        <br/>
